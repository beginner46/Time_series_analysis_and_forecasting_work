# Time_series_analysis_and_forecasting_work

This repository covers the work on time series forecasting that I have doen in the summers of 2022.

## Using Times series and forecasting to predict opening price of a stock [click](https://github.com/beginner46/Time_series_analysis_and_forecasting_work/blob/main/TSAF_tata_steel.zip)

Performed time series analysis and forecasting of opening price of Tata Steel

## Smoothing time series

Performed smoothing out of the irregular roughness to better see patterns, trends, and smooth out the seasonality to better identify the trend. [click](https://github.com/beginner46/Time_series_analysis_and_forecasting_work/blob/main/Smoothing_time_series_moving_averages-main.zip)

## Trimming 

Trimming time series data is important for noise reduction, improved analysis, data compression, focusing on relevant periods, handling missing values, enhancing visual representation, meeting statistical assumptions, and improving computational efficiency.

## Anamoly Detection

The Holt-Winters model is frequently used for anomaly detection due to its effectiveness in handling time series data with trend and seasonality. Its ability to capture underlying patterns and identify deviations from those patterns makes it well-suited for detecting anomalies.
